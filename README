To run a simulation you have to change the values of the network in the file "DEFINITIONS.hpp". Afterwards you use the following command to start the program:

make -B && ./main



The index of the values is listed in the following order (from left to right in the files):

0  Nodes
1  Degree
2  Number of attractors in this realization
3  Length of the attractor cycle
4  Number of frozen nodes in the cycle
5  Frozen node flips leading to the same attractor
6  Frozen node flips leading to a transition
7  Number of active nodes in the cycle
8  Active node flips leading to the same attractor
9  Active node flips leading to a transition
10 Number of states in this attractors basin of attraction
11 Number of garden-of-Eden states in this attractors basin of attraction
